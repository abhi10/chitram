# Image Hosting App - Phase 3 Requirements (Web UI)

## Overview

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for Phase 3 (Web UI) of the Image Hosting Application using the **EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Specification)** format.

**Phase 3 Goal:** Add a web-based user interface using HTMX and Jinja2 templates for image gallery, upload, and user management.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 complete (Auth + Thumbnails)

> **Note:** This document defines *what* to build (requirements). For implementation *progress* and *status*, see [TODO.md](./TODO.md).

## EARS Patterns Reference

| Pattern | Template | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Ubiquitous** | The [system] shall [action] | Always-on behavior |
| **Event-driven** | When [trigger], the [system] shall [action] | Response to events |
| **State-driven** | While [state], the [system] shall [action] | Behavior during states |
| **Optional** | Where [feature enabled], the [system] shall [action] | Configurable features |
| **Unwanted** | If [condition], then the [system] shall [action] | Error/edge cases |

## Architecture Decision

**Technology Stack:** HTMX + Jinja2 + TailwindCSS (monorepo)

| Option Evaluated | Verdict | Reason |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| **HTMX + Jinja2** | ✅ Chosen | Python-only, fast iteration, no JS build step |
| React SPA | ❌ Deferred | Separate toolchain, overkill for MVP |
| Next.js | ❌ Deferred | Node.js runtime, extra complexity |
